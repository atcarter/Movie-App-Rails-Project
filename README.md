# Movie-App-Rails-Project

This repository allows anyone to download a movie review web application that allows users to post their own movie reviews as well as see the reviews of other users. A user can also edit and delete their own reviews.


## Installation

This web app will be locally hosted on your machine. First, clone this repository. Then, run `bundle install` to ensure all gems are present. Once this is complete, run `rails s`, go to the "/" route. You will be redirected to the login page where you can either sign in using Google or create your account within the application. Once you sign up, you can add your own reviews!

## Contributor's Guide

Feel free to help expand the functionality of this application. Eventually, I would like to add the API that I used for my movie_cli app to have a movie's actual information associated with each movie object.
